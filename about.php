        <h2>IT’S GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <p>History tells us that the town of “Torrijos” was a vast plain noted for her rich natural beauties and abundant resources. The majestic Mt. Malindig and its green forest, the rivers that flows from its summit to the vast plain of Malibago and the lowlands of Tigwi, the mineral ores deep under Torrijos’ earth, and the sea which teem with fish and other marine products, maybe considered prime factors that attracted people of other places to settle in this community.</p>

            <p>On or about the year 1877-1880, some prominent persons of  Sta.Cruz, owners of big  parcels of  land  far abour the southern part of the town, willfully and  solicutely determined  to build a town to facilitate their religious duties towards God and their civic obligations  to  the  state,  started  talking  with  the  people  concerned and secured their interest and  help in  realizing  their  objectives of  making  a   town  in  this  part  of  the province.</p>

            <p>When they have secured the sympathy and confidence of the people, they began their campaign through the Rev. Fr. Baltazar Leano of Sta. Cruz. They made representations with the governor of the province, then Mindoro, to which the island of Marinduque was attached.  The request was benignly granted a temporary decree was issued.   The governadorcillo of Sta. Cruz was authorized together with the prominent men and officials to select the place where to erect the town. In as much as the church, rather than the state had a stronger say during the time,   Fr.  Baltazar Leano had the ultimate approval with regards to the place.  Some outstanding person in the locality proposed that the site of the town be established in Tigwi, but a light majority voted for its establishment in Matuyatuya.  By area son of convenience and distance from Sta. Cruz, Fr. Leano consented and thus, the town was erected at Matuyatuya.</p>

           <p> Not long after the completion of the church building, the “Tribunal” and the “Scola Pint”, terrible lightnings and thunder occurred. The church was destroyed by the lightning. The people was terrified by this phenomenal occurrences and considered them a bad omen sent by God to the new town.  They resolved to transfer the town to another place. Again, the Rev. Fr. Baltazar, being the Curate of the Visits, moved by the petition of the people finally yielded to the plan of transferring the site of the town to Tigwi. Thus, the town was erected in Tigwi.</p>

                <p>For a time, the people thought that God was honored and they were delighted that</p>

                <p>He had given them an abode of peaceful life.  Nevertheless, as the saying goes “Man Proposes and God disposes.”  A terrible sickness swept the new town. A pestilence nearly exterminated the population of the town.  The people were so afraid again that they fled to live elsewhere. these two incidents were carefully related to the “governador”.  Fear gripped the hearts of the town’s people. Sacrifices of propitiation were offered to God by the venerable pastor who greatly mourned the fate of this flock. The good Padre tried his best to comfort the people and persuaded them to try their luck once more.</p>

            <p>Through the efforts of the Padre, the “governadorcillo” called all the scattered inhabitants. A meeting was held. In that meeting, it was resolved that the town be re-established between the two unlucky spots. The place they selected was a wide fertile plain, presently called Marlangga. However, the town buildings were endangered by the frequent floods each year. Finally the government appropriated the site of the town owned by a man named Don Gavino Rivamonte. In exchange for the site that is now Torrijos, Poblacion the government gave him another parcel of land in Sibuyao.</p>

            <p>The “propietarios” of the town decided to have a permanent “curaparroco” so they made representation with the Archbishops of Manila, Mogsignor Nozaleda, to assign a permanent priest to Torrijos. They guaranteed to give a new priest who may be assigned a decent livelihood and necessary sustenance. They also gave The “Mitra” several hectares of a land. Rev. Fr. Baltazar Leano was assigned as the first town’s “Cura Parroco” for Torrijos.  This newly assigned priest work hard to secure a “Curate” of “Parroqiua” corresponding to our independent municipality.  Thus, Archbishop Nozaleda, as “Governor-General” issued a decree about the year 1882 furnishing Rev. Fr. Leano the necessary materials for the new parish and town.</p>

            <p>A rare coincidence happened while the prominent man in the newly established town were discussing about the to be given to the town. The ranch owners suggested that the town be called “Torrilos” (small cattle) because there were plenty of cattle in this place during that time.  The question of naming the town was finlly solve when the governor from Calapan, Mindoro arrived to inspect the island of Marinduque. The matter was courteously referred to him. In the end, the people requested that the town be named after the “Governador” himself. The “governador” finally agreed after some persuasion and so, our town was named Torrijos in honor of captain Torrijos, the kind-hearted “governador” who came to visit the happy and contended early settlers of this town of Marinduque.</p>

                <p>Historical records found in the National Achieves and the National Library give the following “Foundation Civil “of Torrijos;</p>

           <p> “Real Orden Mun.469 de 25 de Mayo 1880 approvado la creaciondel pueblo de Torrijos on la isla Marinduque del Provincia de Mindoro”</p>

                   <p>The latest research had the following letter:</p>
